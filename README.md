# Generating a release build of an app

To generate a release build for Android, run the following cli command:

`ionic cordova build android --prod --release`

# Signing an APK

To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the Android SDK:

`jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore ./release.keystore ./platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk cymbit`

Finally, the zip align tool must be ran to optimize the APK:

`./zipalign -v 4 ./platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk ASP.apk`
